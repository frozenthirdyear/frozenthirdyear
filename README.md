- 👋 Hi, I’m @frozenthirdyear
- 👀 I’m interested in modding games (Skyrim) and making 3D characters and props from scratch.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning 3D character creation and basic Papyrus scripting for Skyrim.
- 💞️ I’m not currently looking to collaborate. I'm strictly a parlor modder.
- 📫 How to reach me: Twitter under the same name.
